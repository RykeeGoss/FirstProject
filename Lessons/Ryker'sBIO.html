<body>
Ryker was born September 30th in Kentucky to the BEST family EVER! He currently still lives in Kentucky with his family.
He has 1 brother, 1 sister, AMAZING parents, a fish (ghost shrimp), and the cutest fur pet...Willow (a boxer dog). 
Most days you can find him playing outside, shooting hoops, riding bikes, or trying to win a family round of 4-square!
